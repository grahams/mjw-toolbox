# The donkey tunnel vpn!
# This ikev2 setup creates an ipsec vpn between obsdfw and sietchtabr.
# It makes security associations which match all traffic between those
# two routers, between those routers' LANs, and between either router's
# LAN and the other router's public IP.
# There are associated rules in pf.conf restricting what LAN endpoints
# can talk to each other through the VPN.
# The encapsulated packets are presented on enc1 instead of enc0, to
# differentiate more easily from the other ipsec vpn for filtering.
# There is a hostname.enc1 file installed in /etc by this repo to ensure
# that interface is created.
